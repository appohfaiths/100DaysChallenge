## Week 1

| Day  | Theme    | Tip   |
| :------------- | :---------- | :----------- |
| 1 | Interest in Challenge | You are here because you want to be a part of the #100DaysChallenge. You probably would like to use today to think through your motivation for wanting to participate in this Challenge. Is it to gain new skills to apply for a new role, ask for a promotion, build projects, start a company or have fun? Whatever reason you have is valid. Welcome to the Challenge. |
| 2 | Goals and Quiz | You decided to embark on a journey to invest in yourself. Congrats! This will be a good time to set some goals and put them in writing. What do you want to achieve by the end of the 100 days? If you're still unsure of what to learn, take this quiz:  https://www.codecademy.com/explore/sorting-quiz. |
| 3 | Accountability Partner | "If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together." Having an accountability partner on your learning journey can be a source of support and motivation to keep going. Are you searching for an accountability partner? Share your interests and connect with others [here](https://twitter.com/ivybarley/status/1477920164842778624).
| 4 | Finding the Best Courses and Tutorials| Wondering where to find the best online courses and tutorials in Programming, Data Science, DevOps and Design? Go to https://hackr.io/. When a course or tutorial is submitted, the community upvotes and the best rises to the top. |
| 5 | Popular Coding Websites | These are some of the popular websites with coding resources: https://freecodecamp.com, https://w3schools.com, https://codecademy.com, https://sololearn.com, https://khanacademy.org, https://edx.org, https://theodinproject.com, https://coursera.org and https://ocw.mit.edu. |
| 6 | No Computer? | Ideally, you'd want to have a personal computer to use for your tech lessons & projects. However, some circumstances may not allow that. You're still not left behind. You can use mobile apps like Sololearn, Mimo, Udemy, DataCamp, etc  to learn. |
| 7 | When to Build Projects | Should you try to learn everything before building projects or build projects while you're learning? I suggest building projects (no matter how small) as you learn to appreciate the practical application of the course material.|


## Week 2
| Day  | Theme    | Tip   |
| :------------- | :---------- | :----------- |
| 8 | Joining Communities | When you join the right tech communities, you become part of a support system, get access to resources, mentors and opportunities to give back. Read [this post](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/ivybarley_techcommunities-techjourney-networking-activity-6869188044382191616-AZTK) about the importance of tech communities and recommendations of which ones you can join. |
| 9 | Remote Pair Programming | Have you considered remote pair programming? With this, you can share your screen with someone to collaboratively design, build and review projects. Anyone, in any stage of their learning journey can participate in pair programming. |
| 10 | Show Your Work | I know some people are comfortable with sharing their projects publicly while others are not. Sharing your projects and learning progress publicly using platforms like GitHub, LinkedIn, Twitter and Medium helps with accountability and consistency, and exposes you to potential recruiters and mentors.|
| 11 | Git and GitHub | On the topic of openly sharing your work, GitHub is one of the perfect places to do so. Not only do you get to show your work, you can contribute to other people's projects. If you're new to Git and GitHub, read this article: https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/git-and-github-for-beginners/.|
| 12 | Screen Recordings | Aside sharing screenshots and links, you could do screen recordings of your projects using an app like OBS Studio and share on platforms like LinkedIn. Video content does well on LinkedIn and could help increase your visibility on the platform.|
| 13 | Twitter Spaces | People are gaining knowledge, hearing of job opportunities, meeting new people and getting access to resources by participating in Twitter Spaces. This is a personal and professional development opportunity right at your fingertips. If interested, RSVP for my tech and career Twitter Spaces at http://spaceswithivy.com. |
| 14 | Taking Notes | One thing you should do in your learning journey is to take notes that you can refer to in the future. Some note-taking apps like Notion have features for adding images, boards, code blocks that support multiple programming languages, wikis, etc. My favorite note-taking app is Notion. What about you?|

## Week 3
| Day  | Theme    | Tip   |
| :------------- | :---------- | :----------- |
| 15 | Create Your Cheat Sheet |On the topic of taking notes while you learn, you can even create your own cheat sheets for quick referencing. You can create cheat sheets using https://cheatography.com/. They also have over 4,000 free cheat sheets and quick references.|
| 16 | Google or Bing it | You don't know everything and that's okay. No one does anyway. If it's taking you forever to solve a problem or you need further explanation on a topic, Google or Bing it. Someone is very likely to have been in your shoes before.|
| 17 | Stack Overflow | Are you getting stuck because of the stack you chose? Go to [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) to learn from others' experiences with similar challenges. It can get overwhelming at the beginning but you'd get the hang of it as times goes on.|
| 18 | subreddits | If you are looking for online communities around what you are learning, consider joining subreddits on those topics. There are subreddits on almost every area of tech you could think of and the people in these communities are usually supportive.|
| 19 | Twitter Topics | Do you know about the Topics feature on Twitter? With this, you can personalize your timeline by following topics that are of interest to you. There are diverse technical and non-technical topics you can follow to curate your timeline as you learn.|
| 20 | Teach Someone Else | Did you recently learn how APIs work? Or the importance of customer empathy when building products? Try teaching someone something you learnt this week. Research shows that explaining something to other people helps us understand it better. |
| 21 | 3-week Check | It's been 3 weeks since we started the 2022 #100DaysChallenge to learn new tech skills and openly share our journey online. People are learning UI/UX design, data engineering, product management, technical writing, software development, etc. How has it been so far? |

## Week 4
| Day  | Theme    | Tip   |
| :------------- | :---------- | :----------- |
| 22 | Python Projects | If you are learning Python, these are 25 beginner friendly Python projects you can start working on today: https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/python-projects-for-beginners/. |
| 23 | Product Management Books |If you are learning product management, this is a visual guide of the best product management books as well as an article describing why each book was recommended: https://www.delibr.com/post/visual-guide-to-the-best-books-on-product-management. |
| 24 | Consistency | When developing a new habit like learning a new skill, consistency is key. You don't always have to feel like learning but still show up anyway, even if it's for a few minutes. Don't underestimate the power of consistency.|
| 25 | Follow Tech Professionals | I saw a tweet that said that the only 2 tech professionals you'd see on Twitter are programmers and UI/UX designers. False. 😂 On social media platforms like Twitter, you'd find people who specialize in different areas of tech (both technical and non-technical) who share a lot of useful resources. Follow them.|
| 26 | Web Development Roadmaps | If you are learning web development, these developer roadmaps will be useful: Frontend (https://roadmap.sh/frontend), Backend (https://roadmap.sh/backend), Angular (https://roadmap.sh/angular), React (https://roadmap.sh/react).|
| 27 | DevOps Roadmap | If you are learning DevOps, this roadmap will be useful: https://roadmap.sh/devops. |
| 28 | Music Playlist | Do you listen to music while learning? Do you have a learning playlist? What kind of music works best for you? 💃🏾 |

## Week 5
| Day  | Theme    | Tip   |
